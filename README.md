# Summary of a Fungible Token ERC20

This code creates KaseiCoin. KaseiCoin is a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant. I simulated a crowdsale that  allows people to convert their money to KaseiCoin.

This token was minted using a ```Crowdsale``` contract from OpenZeppelin Solidity library.

The crowdsale contract that I created manages the entire crowdsale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KAI, or KaseiCoin tokens. This contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.


### Usage

Create and compile the KaseiCoin Token Contract
